# Boids_OpenGL3D

This project is a 3D Boids simulation implemented using OpenGL and Pygame. The simulation visualizes the flocking behavior of boids (bird-like objects) in a 3D space.

## Features

- 3D visualization of boids using OpenGL
- Flocking behavior including alignment, cohesion, and separation
- Camera controls to rotate and zoom in/out
- Automatic reset to initial state after a specified time

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame
- PyOpenGL
