# Boids_OpenGL3D

This project is a 3D Boids simulation implemented using OpenGL and Pygame. The simulation visualizes the flocking behavior of boids  in a 3D space.

## Features

- 3D visualization of boids using OpenGL
- Flocking behavior including alignment, cohesion, and separation
- Camera controls to rotate and zoom in/out
- Automatic reset to initial state after a specified time

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame
- PyOpenGL

## Controls
- Arrow Keys: Rotate the camera
- A Key: Zoom in
- Z Key: Zoom out

## Code Overview
boids_simulation.py: Main script that runs the simulation
Boid class: Defines the behavior and properties of each boid
draw_box function: Draws the boundary box for the simulation
Background
I remember seeing a similar example in an old OpenGL textbook. I thought it would be fun to recreate the same thing using Python. After all, it's a textbook, so it should at least include the source code! ðŸ˜„
